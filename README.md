# Scheduler Sim

Basically an Object oriented playground for scheduling algos
(also for I think C's function pointer based runtime polymorphism
would have been a better fit here, since the switch case
is ugly)

This was made for my OS course, in about a total devtime of 2 hours
Code is not the best, and it is made to be extensible
in unlikely case that I want to test a new algorithm in the future
